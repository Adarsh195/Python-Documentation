            <p>Python is a high level general-purpose programming language. It uses a multi-paradigm approach, meaning
                it supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional programming constructs.</p>
            <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. It is
                used for:</p>
            <ul class="describe">
                <li>web development (server-side),</li>
                <li>software development,</li>
                <li>mathematics,</li>
                <li>system scripting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We preffer python over other language because:</p>
            <ul class="describe">
                <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
                <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
                <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other
                    programming languages.</li>
                <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written.
                    This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
                <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header class="head">Hello World</header>
            <p>Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py)
                files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

            </p>
            <p>The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:</p>
            <code class="ppap">C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</code>
            <p>Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.</p>
            <p>Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.</p>
            <div class="code"><code>print("Hello, World!")
                </code></div>
            <p>Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your
                file, and run the above command and you get your output.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Indentation">
            <header class="head">Python Indentation</header>
            <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

                Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in
                Python is very important.

                Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
            <div class="code"><code>
                    if a&lt;10:</code><br>&nbsp;
                <code>print("Right choice.")
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:</p>
            <div class="code error"><code>
                    if a&lt;10:</code><br>
                <code>print("Right choice.")
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least
                one.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
            <header class="head">Comments</header>
            <p>Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.</p>

            <p>Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:</p>
            <div class="code"><code>
                    #This is an example of comment.</code><br>
                <code>print("Hello There")
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>Python don't have any syntax for mulit-line comments to do so we can use multiple '#' to achive the
                solution.</p>
            <p>Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

                Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline
                string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:</p>
            <div class="code"><code>
                        """</code><br><code>This is an example of comment</code><br>
                <code>which is return in</code><br>
                <code>more than one line</code><br><code>"""</code><br>
                <code>print("Hello There")
                    </code>
            </div>
            <p>As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and
                you have made a multiline comment.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header class="head">Variables</header>
            <p>Variable is a name that is used to refer to memory location. Python variable is also known as an
                identifier and used to hold value.
                In Python, we don't need to specify the type of variable because Python is a infer language and smart
                enough to get variable type.
                Variable names can be a group of both the letters and digits, but they have to begin with a letter or an
                underscore.
                It is recommended to use lowercase letters for the variable name. Rahul and rahul both are two different
                variables.</p>
            <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.Python has no command for declaring a variable .A
                variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
            <div class="code"><code>
                A = 21</code><br><code>x = "Phoenix"</code><br>
                <code>print(A)</code><br>
                <code>print(x)</code>
            </div>
            <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have
                been set i.e. we can declare x=12 and then can change it to x="hello".</p>
            <p>We can typecast variables very easily as follows:</p>
            <div class="code"><code>
                    A = str(32)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# A will be '32'</code><br>
                <code>m = int(3.67)&nbsp;# m will be 3</code><br>
                <code>x = float(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;# x will be 1.0</code><br>
            </div>
            <p>You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Global_Variables">
            <header class="head">Global Variables</header>
            <p>Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global
                variables.
                Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.</p>




            <div class="code"><code>
                    x = "awesome"</code><br><br><code>def myfunc():</code><br>
                <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x = "fantastic"</code><br>
                <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Python is " + x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#prints 'Python is fantastic'</code><br><br>
                <code>myfunc()</code><br><br>
                <code>print("Python is " + x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#prints 'Python is awesome'</code><br>
            </div>
            <p>Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used
                inside that function.
                To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.
                Also, use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>x="amazing"</code><br><br>
                <code>def myfunc():</code><br>

                <br>
                <code>myfunc()</code><br><br>

            <header class="head">Data Types</header>
            <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.

                Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

                Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Text Type: str</li>
                <li>Numeric Types: int, float, complex</li>
                <li>Sequence Types: list, tuple, range</li>
                <li> Mapping Type: dict</li>
                <li> Set Types: set, frozenset</li>
                <li> Boolean Type: bool</li>
                <li>Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview</li>
                <li> None Type: NoneType</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_List">
            <header class="head">Python List</header>
            <p>Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

                Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are
                Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

            </p>
            <p>Lists are created using square brackets:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]</code><br>
                <code>print(thislist[2])&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#prints cherry</code><br>
            </div>
            <p>List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

                List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.</p>
            <p>When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not
                change.

                If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.</p>
            <p>The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been
                created.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="If_else">
            <header class="head">If else</header>
            <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Equals: a == b</li>
                <li> Not Equals: a != b</li>
                <li> Less than: a &lt; b</li>
                <li> Less than or equal to: a &lt;= b</li>
                <li> Greater than: a > b</li>
                <li> Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.</p>

            <p>An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>a = 33</code><br>
                <code>b = 200</code><br>
                <code>if b > a:</code><br>
                <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("b is greater than a")</code>
            </div>
            <p>In this example we use two variables, a and b,
                which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is
                200,
                we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".</p>
            <p>The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>a = 200</code><br>
                <code>a = 33</code><br>
                <code>if b > a:</code><br>
                <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("b is greater than a")</code><br>
                <code>elif a == b:</code><br>
                <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("a and b are equal")</code><br>
                <code>else:</code><br>
                <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("a is greater than b")</code>
            </div>
            <p>In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not
                true, so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="While_Loop">
            <header class="head">While Loop</header>
            <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>
            <div class="code">



                <code>#Print i as long as i is less than 6</code><br>
                <code>i = 1</code><br>
                <code>while i &lt; 6:</code><br>
                <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(i)</code><br>

                <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i += 1</code>
            </div>
            <p><b>Note:</b> remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.</p>
            <p>The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready,
                in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true.</li>
                <li>With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next.</li>
                <li>With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.</li>
            </ul>
